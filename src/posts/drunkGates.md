# Drunk Gates

This is a Eurorack format gate generator based on clock divisions and 'swing'.  It's centered around an Arduino Nano 33 iot with four gate outputs, two knob inputs, and one CV input in the form of a vactrol.Â The left knob controls the amount of swing, and the right knob controls the number of divisions with each output getting halved from Left-Right, Top-Bottom.  The CV input adjusts the amount of swing on each output.
